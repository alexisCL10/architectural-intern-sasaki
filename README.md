During my summer internship, we were assigned a site to design, replace, and change in ways that serve the people, enhance the quality of life, and collaborate with the community. I made a Virtual 3D Model in SketchUp. This 3D model is based on our assigned site called "Groundwork's Somerville Urban Farm". I've also made a diagram from a website called "Felt" that shows access points, residential areas, and commercial areas. The last diagram shows our plans for the new design of our site.
